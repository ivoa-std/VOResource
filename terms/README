VOResource 1.1 has externalised most of the enumerations of terms.  These term
lists are maintained in this directory in simple CSV format, together with a
little python script to create from them standards-conforming vocabulary
resources for the Web.

NOTE: CSV separator is ";".  Since our descriptions will have lots of commas in
them, this helps to keep the necessity for quoting low.

To build the vocabularies, at this point say:

	python convert.py vocabs.conf

To test them before deploying them, you need to set the root URL to 
where you run an apache, e.g.,
	
	python convert.py --install-root=http://localhost/voctest vocabs.conf

You then need to copy the directories generated to the referenced location.

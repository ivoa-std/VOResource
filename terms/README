VOResource 1.1 has externalised most of the enumerations of terms.  These term
lists are maintained in this directory in simple CSV format, together with a
little python script to create from them standards-conforming vocabulary
resources for the Web.

NOTE: CSV separator is ";".  Since our descriptions will have lots of commas in
them, this helps to keep the necessity for quoting low.

To build the vocabularies, at this point say:

	make

This will bulid the vocabulary files in subdirectories of the current
directory.

To test them before deploying them, you need to set TEST_DEST (something
you can rsync to) and TEST_ROOT_URL (the root URL of where TEST_DEST installs
to) in the Makefile,

	TEST_DEST=/var/www/html/vocab-test
	TEST_URL_ROOT=http://localhost/vocab-test

Then, make test-install should to the trick, provided you have the necessary
privileges.

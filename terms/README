VOResource 1.1 has externalised most of the enumerations of terms.  These term
lists are maintained in this directory in simple CSV format, together with a
little python script to create from them standards-conforming vocabulary
resources for the Web.

NOTE: CSV separator is ";".  Since our descriptions will have lots of commas in
them, this helps to keep the necessity for quoting low.

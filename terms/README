VOResource 1.1 has externalised most of the enumerations of terms.  These term
lists are maintained in this directory in simple CSV format, together with a
little python script to create from them standards-conforming vocabulary
resources for the Web.

NOTE: CSV separator is ";".  Since our descriptions will have lots of commas in
them, this helps to keep the necessity for quoting low.

To build the vocabularies, at this point say:

	make

This will bulid the vocabulary files in subdirectories of the current
directory; you'll need python2 and rapper (Debian package:
rapter2-utils) installed for this to work.

To test them before deploying them, you need to set TEST_DEST (something
you can rsync to) and TEST_ROOT_URL (the root URL of where TEST_DEST installs
to) in the Makefile,

	TEST_DEST=/var/www/html/vocab-test
	TEST_URL_ROOT=http://localhost/vocab-test

Then, make test-install should to the trick, provided you have the necessary
privileges.


To make the conditional rewriting work, the directory needs to be served
from an apache web server (or anything that will interpret the .htaccess
files).  Furthermore, the deployment directory or one of its parents
must be configured to allow rewrites in .htaccess, somewhat like this:

    <Directory /var/www/docs/vocab-test>
          AllowOverride FileInfo
    </Directory>

And, of course, mod_rewrite must be loaded in the server.
